Deep learning based software for prediction of menstrual cycle

## What is WiselyAndHealthy

WiselyAndHealthy is a deep learning based software that helps women to get to know the needs of their body and hygiene and to use those informations with the prediction of menstrual cycle to have a better, more conscious and more comfortable life.

## Inspiration

It is so hard to see that women all around the world suffer from terrible problems. It is hard to imagine, things and opportunities which are obvious at one place of the Earth, are inaccessible in other places. We know the power of data and of visualization so we decided to try to help with tools we handle professionally.

## What it does

### Core

Our core solution is a lightweight deep learning model that can predict different aspects of the menstrual cycle. The lightweightness of the model is a key resource since this way not only cutting edge smartphones or computers count as a target of our software.

### Additional stuff

We would like to add as much information data visualisation or infographics  as possible to our application for the women. We are not experts on this topic since we are deep learning developers and data scientists only. Therefore we will ask for help from top most experts of women rights.

### Workflow

The workflow is very simple yet powerful. The user gives or confirms data about the beginning and end of their menstrual cycle and the application predicts the next cycle or warns the user about possible problems with their actual cycle. The user can set up reminders. They can visualize historical data and they can receive hints about fertile or even about non-fertile periods.

### Features

Key features of our application is secure storage of personal menstrual cycle data. Because of the lightweightness of the application no one has to share their data with a server or something like that. From local data with the use of local resources our application can predict the next menstrual cycle and it can set up automatic reminders before the beginning of the predicted cycle. Our software can show warnings if there is a difference between predictions and real cycle. The application can make suggestions in relation with family planning, in fact it means information about potential fertile or non-fertile days. The app can visualize the user’s data in many ways.

## How we built it

As we had the core idea, we tried to search for some dataset to train a good model. Though there are several similar applications, finding a dataset seemed to be hard. So we had to change our direction to figure out best practices to create criteria to the data and to the application as well.

We collected a lot of information about the topic and about the issues that the similar applications still have. We applied various practices from different other fields as we planned our solution to this challenge.

We made the needed material to submit this project and now we are waiting for a successful future with WiselyAndHealthy.

## Challenges we ran into

We did a lot of research to go deep in this problem. This was separated into two big parts. The first was the background of problems such as poverty, daily struggles of women, and barriers. The second phase is connected to the body of women and the menstruation cycle,  such as the length of menstruation, length of fertile and non-fertile days, typical and non-typical menstruation cycles. Since we are deep learning developers and data scientists, we had to learn a lot. These sources were really useful:

## What we learned

We learned some really disturbing facts about how struggling is for women to have the necessary hygiene during menstruation. Other shocking knowledge is that menstruation itself is a barrier to opportunities, it reinforces gender inequality. Some restrictions are cultural, such as prohibitions on handling food or entering religious spaces, or the requirement that women and girls isolate themselves.Poverty and humanitarian crises can limit women’s and girls’ access to culturally appropriate menstrual supplies and safe, private washing facilities. We already read about these types of discriminations, but there is a difference between reading an article about it or spending hours reading about them. 

## What's next for WiselyAndHealthy

We are absolutely devoted to continuing with WiselyAndHealthy. Since the project requires a lot of special knowledge we cannot do it alone on our own. If we give a chance from experts to continue, we will be really happy, since we learned, that knowing and talking about discrimination or inequalities is not enough, everybody have to stand up and act.
